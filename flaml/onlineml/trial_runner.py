    NOTE about the status of a trial:
        Trial.PENDING: All trials are set to be pending when frist added into the OnlineTrialRunner until
            it is selected to run. By this definition, a trial with status Trial.PENDING is a challenger
            trial added to the OnlineTrialRunner but never been selected to run.
            It denotes the starting of trial's lifespan in the OnlineTrialRunner.
        Trial.RUNNING: It indicates that this trial is one of the concurrently running trials.
            The max number of Trial.RUNNING trials is running_budget.
            The status of a trial will be set to Trial.RUNNING the next time it selected to run.
            A trial's status may have the following change:
            Trial.PENDING -> Trial.RUNNING
            Trial.PAUSED - > Trial.RUNNING
        Trial.PAUSED: The status of a trial is set to Trial.PAUSED once it is removed from the running trials.
            Trial.RUNNING - > Trial.PAUSED
        Trial.TERMINATED: set the status of a trial to Trial.TERMINATED when you never want to select it.
            It denotes the real end of a trial's lifespan.
        Status change routine of a trial
        Trial.PENDING -> (Trial.RUNNING -> Trial.PAUSED -> Trial.RUNNING -> ...) -> Trial.TERMINATED(optional)
