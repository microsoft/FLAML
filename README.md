FLAML is a lightweight Python library that finds accurate machine
learning models automatically, efficiently and economically. It frees users from selecting
learners and hyperparameters for each learner. It is fast and economical.
The simple and lightweight design makes it easy to extend, such as
adding customized learners or metrics. FLAML is powered by a new, [cost-effective
hyperparameter optimization](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/flaml/tune)
and learner selection method invented by Microsoft Research.
FLAML leverages the structure of the search space to choose a search order optimized for both cost and error. For example, the system tends to propose cheap configurations at the beginning stage of the search,
but quickly moves to configurations with high model complexity and large sample size when needed in the later stage of the search. For another example, it favors cheap learners in the beginning but penalizes them later if the error improvement is slow. The cost-bounded search and cost-based prioritization make a big difference in the search efficiency under budget constraints.

FLAML has a .NET implementation as well from [ML.NET Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder). This [ML.NET blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-june-updates/#new-and-improved-automl) describes the improvement brought by FLAML.

## Installation

FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.6**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install flaml
```

To run the [`notebook example`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook),
install flaml with the [notebook] option:

```bash
pip install flaml[notebook]
```

## Quickstart

* With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast
AutoML engine as a scikit-learn style estimator.

```python
from flaml import AutoML
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification")
```

* You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning
tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a customized learner.

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification", estimator_list=["lgbm"])
```

* You can also run generic ray-tune style hyperparameter tuning for a custom function.

```python
from flaml import tune
tune.run(train_with_config, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)
```

## Advantages

* For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, find quality models with small computational resources.
* Users can choose their desired customizability: minimal customization (computational resource budget), medium customization (e.g., scikit-style learner, search space and metric), full customization (arbitrary training and evaluation code).
* Allow human guidance in hyperparameter tuning to respect prior on certain subspaces but also able to explore other subspaces. Read more about the
hyperparameter optimization methods
in FLAML [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/flaml/tune). They can be used beyond the AutoML context.
And they can be used in distributed HPO frameworks such as ray tune or nni.
* Support online AutoML: automatic hyperparameter tuning for online learning algorithms. Read more about the online AutoML method in FLAML [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/flaml/onlineml).

## Examples

* A basic classification example.

```python
from flaml import AutoML
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
# Initialize an AutoML instance
automl = AutoML()
# Specify automl goal and constraint
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 10,  # in seconds
    "metric": 'accuracy',
    "task": 'classification',
    "log_file_name": "test/iris.log",
}
X_train, y_train = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
# Train with labeled input data
automl.fit(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train,
           **automl_settings)
# Predict
print(automl.predict_proba(X_train))
# Export the best model
print(automl.model)
```

* A basic regression example.

```python
from flaml import AutoML
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
# Initialize an AutoML instance
automl = AutoML()
# Specify automl goal and constraint
automl_settings = {
    "time_budget": 10,  # in seconds
    "metric": 'r2',
    "task": 'regression',
    "log_file_name": "test/boston.log",
}
X_train, y_train = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True)
# Train with labeled input data
automl.fit(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train,
           **automl_settings)
# Predict
print(automl.predict(X_train))
# Export the best model
print(automl.model)
```

* Time series forecasting.

```python
# pip install flaml[forecast]
import numpy as np
from flaml import AutoML
X_train = np.arange('2014-01', '2021-01', dtype='datetime64[M]')
y_train = np.random.random(size=72)
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train=X_train[:72],  # a single column of timestamp
           y_train=y_train,  # value for each timestamp
           period=12,  # time horizon to forecast, e.g., 12 months
           task='forecast', time_budget=15,  # time budget in seconds
           log_file_name="test/forecast.log",
          )
print(automl.predict(X_train[72:]))
```

* Learning to rank.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from flaml import AutoML
X_train, y_train = fetch_openml(name="credit-g", return_X_y=True, as_frame=False)
y_train = y_train.cat.codes
# not a real learning to rank dataaset
groups = [200] * 4 + [100] * 2    # group counts
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(
    X_train, y_train, groups=groups,
    task='rank', time_budget=10,    # in seconds
)
```

## Developing

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML.git
pip install -e .[test,notebook]
```

### Docker

We provide a simple [Dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/Dockerfile).

```bash
docker build git://github.com/microsoft/FLAML -t flaml-dev
docker run -it flaml-dev
```

### Develop in Remote Container

If you use vscode, you can open the FLAML folder in a [Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
We have provided the configuration in [.devcontainer]((https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/.devcontainer)).

### Pre-commit

Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your git hooks. Before you commit, run
`pre-commit run` to check if you meet the pre-commit requirements. If you use Windows (without WSL) and can't commit after installing pre-commit, you can run `pre-commit uninstall` to uninstall the hook. In WSL or Linux this is supposed to work.

### Coverage

Any code you commit should not decrease coverage. To run all unit tests:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest test
```

Then you can see the coverage report by
`coverage report -m` or `coverage html`.
If all the tests are passed, please also test run notebook/flaml_automl to make sure your commit does not break the notebook example.
