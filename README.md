FLAML is a lightweight Python library that finds accurate machine
learning models automatically, efficiently and economically. It frees users from selecting
learners and hyperparameters for each learner.

1. For common machine learning tasks like classification and regression, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It supports both classifcal machine learning models and deep neural networks.
1. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range: minimal customization (computational resource budget), medium customization (e.g., scikit-style learner, search space and metric), or full customization (arbitrary training and evaluation code).
1. It supports fast automatic tuning, capable of handling complex constraints/guidance/early stopping. FLAML is powered by a new, [cost-effective
hyperparameter optimization](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function/#hyperparameter-optimization-algorithm)
and learner selection method invented by Microsoft Research.

FLAML has a .NET implementation as well from [ML.NET Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder) in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2022. This [ML.NET blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-june-updates/#new-and-improved-automl) describes the improvement brought by FLAML.


## Installation

FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.6**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install flaml
```

To run the [`notebook example`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook),
install flaml with the [notebook] option:

```bash
pip install flaml[notebook]
```

## Quickstart

* With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast
AutoML engine as a scikit-learn style estimator.

```python
from flaml import AutoML
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification")
```

* You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning
tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a customized learner.

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification", estimator_list=["lgbm"])
```

* You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a custom function.

```python
from flaml import tune
tune.run(evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)
```
