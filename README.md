## What is FLAML
FLAML is a lightweight Python library that finds accurate machine
learning models automatically, efficiently and economically. It frees users from selecting
models and hyperparameters for each model. It can also be used to tune generic hyperparameters for foundation models, MLOps/LMOps workflows, pipelines, mathematical/statistical models, algorithms, computing experiments, software configurations and so on.

1. For common machine learning or AI tasks like classification, regression, and generation, it quickly finds quality models for user-provided data with low computational resources. It supports both classical machine learning models and deep neural networks, including foundation models such as the GPT series.
1. It is easy to customize or extend. Users can find their desired customizability from a smooth range: minimal customization (computational resource budget), medium customization (e.g., scikit-style learner, search space and metric), or full customization (arbitrary training and evaluation code).
1. It supports fast automatic tuning, capable of handling complex constraints/guidance/early stopping. FLAML is powered by a new, [cost-effective
hyperparameter optimization](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function/#hyperparameter-optimization-algorithm)
and model selection method invented by Microsoft Research, and many followup [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Research).

FLAML has a .NET implementation in [ML.NET](http://dot.net/ml), an open-source, cross-platform machine learning framework for .NET. In ML.NET, you can use FLAML via low-code solutions like [Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder) Visual Studio extension and the cross-platform [ML.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/automate-training-with-cli). Alternatively, you can use the [ML.NET AutoML API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.AutoML/#versions-body-tab) for a code-first experience.


## Installation

### Python

FLAML requires **Python version >= 3.7**. It can be installed from pip:

```bash
pip install flaml
```

To run the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/tree/main/notebook),
install flaml with the [notebook] option:

```bash
pip install flaml[notebook]
```

### .NET

Use the following guides to get started with FLAML in .NET:

- [Install Model Builder](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/install-model-builder?tabs=visual-studio-2022)
- [Install ML.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/install-ml-net-cli?tabs=windows)
- [Microsoft.AutoML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.AutoML/0.20.0)

## Quickstart

* With three lines of code, you can start using this economical and fast
AutoML engine as a [scikit-learn style estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML).

```python
from flaml import AutoML
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification")
```

* You can restrict the learners and use FLAML as a fast hyperparameter tuning
tool for XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest etc. or a [customized learner](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Task-Oriented-AutoML#estimator-and-search-space).

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="classification", estimator_list=["lgbm"])
```

* You can also run generic hyperparameter tuning for a [custom function](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function).

```python
from flaml import tune
tune.run(evaluation_function, config={…}, low_cost_partial_config={…}, time_budget_s=3600)
```

* [Zero-shot AutoML](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Zero-Shot-AutoML) allows using the existing training API from lightgbm, xgboost etc. while getting the benefit of AutoML in choosing high-performance hyperparameter configurations per task.

```python
from flaml.default import LGBMRegressor

# Use LGBMRegressor in the same way as you use lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.
estimator = LGBMRegressor()
# The hyperparameters are automatically set according to the training data.
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

* (New) You can optimize [generations](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Auto-Generation) by ChatGPT or GPT-4 etc. with your own tuning data, success metrics and budgets.

```python
from flaml import oai

config, analysis = oai.Completion.tune(
    data=tune_data,
    metric="success",
    mode="max",
    eval_func=eval_func,
    inference_budget=0.05,
    optimization_budget=3,
    num_samples=-1,
)
```
