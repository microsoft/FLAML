    "# Interactive LLM Agent Dealing with Web Info\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks, including coding and math problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to discuss a paper based on its URL. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent` without doing any additional steps. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and returns the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`.\n",

    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.7`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [openai] option:\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Further optimization of hyperparameters**: Building upon the proposed EcoOptiGen framework, you could explore more advanced optimization strategies, algorithms, or techniques to achieve better cost-effectiveness and higher generation utility within the constraints of a given budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Optimizing for diverse tasks and domains**: Extend the study to include more tasks or datasets in different domains to better understand the generality of the approach and identify the key contributing factors in cost-effective hyperparameter optimization for large language models.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Real-world application evaluation**: Investigate how the optimization framework fares when applied to real-world applications or industry use cases. This can help identify the practical value of the framework and provide insights into its limitations and potential improvements applicable in a real-world context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Impact of model size and architecture**: Examine the impact of different model sizes and architectures on the performance and cost-effectiveness of the optimization framework. This can help understand how well the framework generalizes to different types of large language models and if there are any specific models that require adaptations of the optimization approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Environment and energy impact**: Explore the energy consumption and environmental impact of optimizing inference hyperparameters for large language models, and investigate how the proposed framework can be adapted or extended to account for sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices in AI and NLP applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please assess which of these directions aligns best with your interests and the paper's content.
