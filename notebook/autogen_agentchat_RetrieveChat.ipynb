    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using RetrieveChat for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a convesational framework for retrieve augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/autogen_agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially,`RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",

    "In this example, the maximum number of tokens for context was set to 500 to simulate a scenario where not all relevant context can be fed into the LLM model. In the first four cases, questions were directly selected from the dataset and even with limited tokens, RetrieveChat was able to answer the questions correctly in the first attempt as the retrieved context contained the necessary information. However, in the fifth case, the question was a combination of two different questions and the context with the highest similarity to the question embedding did not contain the required information to answer the question. As a result, the LLM model responded with `UPDATE CONTEXT. The given context is about Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D. seasons 4 and 5, but does not mention anything about the characters' living locations in This Is Us.` With the unique and innovative ability to update context in RetrieveChat, the agent automatically updated the context and sent it to the LLM model again. After this process, the agent was able to generate the correct answer to the question."
