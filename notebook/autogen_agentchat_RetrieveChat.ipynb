    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using RetrieveChat for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "`flaml.autogen` offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a convesational system for retrieve augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/autogen_agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",

Checks and Balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place . This is based on the idea that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but to give the various branches the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches . They guarantee that the powers of the State have the same weight ( co-equal ) , that is , to be balanced , so that they can limit each other , avoiding the abuse of state power . the origin of checks and balances , like separation of powers itself , is specifically credited to Montesquieu in the Enlightenment ( in The Spirit of the Laws , 1748 ) , under this influence was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States . </P>\n",

Sources cited in a Variety article confirmed that Remini would be returning as Detective Vanessa Cellucci , the character she portrayed in the first - season finale , and that Hayes ' dismissal was for creative reasons and `` not a reflection '' of the actress ' performance .

      "\n",
      "Context is: <P> Many cattle ranches and stations run bulls with cows , and most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one , if not several , bulls for purposes of herd maintenance . However , the problems associated with handling a bull ( particularly where cows must be removed from its presence to be worked ) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination ( AI ) of the cows . Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen , where it is kept until it can be sold , at which time it can be very profitable , in fact , many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose . AI is also used to increase the quality of a herd , or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines . Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright . AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds . </P>\n",
      "<P> Other than the few bulls needed for breeding , the vast majority of male cattle are slaughtered for meat before the age of three years , except where they are needed ( castrated ) as work oxen for haulage . Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating , although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef . A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female , and produces proportionately more , leaner muscle . </P>\n",
      "<P> Pastoral farming is the major land use but there are increases in land area devoted to horticulture . </P>\n",
      "<P> Animal fibers are natural fibers that consist largely of particular proteins . Instances are silk , hair / fur ( including wool ) and feathers . The animal fibers used most commonly both in the manufacturing world as well as by the hand spinners are wool from domestic sheep and silk . Also very popular are alpaca fiber and mohair from Angora goats . Unusual fibers such as Angora wool from rabbits and Chiengora from dogs also exist , but are rarely used for mass production . </P>\n",
      "<P> In 2012 , there were 3.2 million farmers , ranchers and other agricultural managers and an estimated 757,900 agricultural workers were legally employed in the US . Animal breeders accounted for 11,500 of those workers with the rest categorized as miscellaneous agricultural workers . The median pay was $9.12 per hour or $18,970 per year . In 2009 , about 519,000 people under age 20 worked on farms owned by their family . In addition to the youth who lived on family farms , an additional 230,000 youth were employed in agriculture . In 2004 , women made up approximately 24 % of farmers ; that year , there were 580,000 women employed in agriculture , forestry , and fishing . </P>\n",
      "<P> The recipe can vary widely . The defining ingredients are minced meat ( commonly beef when named cottage pie or lamb when named shepherd 's pie ) , typically cooked in a gravy with onions and sometimes other vegetables , such as peas , celery or carrots , and topped with mashed potato . The pie is sometimes also topped with grated cheese . </P>\n",
      "<P> The history of the domesticated sheep goes back to between 11000 and 9000 BC , and the domestication of the wild mouflon in ancient Mesopotamia . Sheep are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans , and there is evidence of sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period . These sheep were primarily raised for meat , milk , and skins . Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BC in Iran , and cultures such as the Persians relied on sheep 's wool for trading . They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading . </P>\n",
      "<P> Although large - scale use of wheels did not occur in the Americas prior to European contact , numerous small wheeled artifacts , identified as children 's toys , have been found in Mexican archeological sites , some dating to about 1500 BC . It is thought that the primary obstacle to large - scale development of the wheel in the Americas was the absence of domesticated large animals which could be used to pull wheeled carriages . The closest relative of cattle present in Americas in pre-Columbian times , the American Bison , is difficult to domesticate and was never domesticated by Native Americans ; several horse species existed until about 12,000 years ago , but ultimately became extinct . The only large animal that was domesticated in the Western hemisphere , the llama , did not spread far beyond the Andes by the time of the arrival of Columbus . </P>\n",
      "<P> The Call of the Wild is a short adventure novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon , Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush , when strong sled dogs were in high demand . The central character of the novel is a dog named Buck . The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley , California , when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska . He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment , where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs . By the end , he sheds the veneer of civilization , and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild . </P>\n",
      "<P> The Three Little Pigs was included in The Nursery Rhymes of England ( London and New York , c. 1886 ) , by James Halliwell - Phillipps . The story in its arguably best - known form appeared in English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs , first published in 1890 and crediting Halliwell as his source . The story begins with the title characters being sent out into the world by their mother , to `` seek out their fortune '' . The first little pig builds a house of straw , but a wolf blows it down and devours him . The second little pig builds a house of sticks , which the wolf also blows down , and the second little pig is also devoured .

      "<P> `` How now brown cow '' ( / ˈhaʊ ˈnaʊ ˈbraʊn ˈkaʊ / ) is a phrase used in elocution teaching to demonstrate rounded vowel sounds . Each `` ow '' sound in the phrase represents the diphthong / aʊ / . Although orthographies for each of the four words in this utterance is represented by the English spelling `` ow '' , the articulation required to create this same diphthong represented by the International Phonetic Association 's phonetic alphabet as / aʊ / is also represented by the spelling `` ou '' . Some examples of these homophonic / aʊ / 's are the English words `` house '' , `` blouse '' , `` noun '' , and `` cloud '' . The use of the phrase `` how now brown cow '' in teaching elocution can be dated back to at least 1926 . Although not in use today , the phrase `` how now '' is a greeting , short for `` how say you now '' , and can be found in archaic literature , such as the plays of William Shakespeare . </P>\n",
      "<P> Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal . The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts , though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally . The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals . As cattle do not have collar bones , these muscles support about 60 % of the body weight of standing / moving cattle . This requires a significant amount of connective tissue , so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue . </P>\n",
      "<P> The music to `` Man Gave Names to All the Animals '' is reggae - inspired . The lyrics were inspired by the biblical Book of Genesis , verses 2 : 19 -- 20 in which Adam named the animals and birds . The lyrics have an appeal to children , rhyming the name of the animal with one of its characteristics . So after describing an animal 's `` muddy trail '' and `` curly tail , '' Dylan sings that `` he was n't too small and he was n't too big '' and so that animal was named a pig . Similarly , the cow got its name because Adam `` saw milk comin ' out but he did n't know how '' and the bear got its name because it has a `` great big furry back and furry hair . '' </P>\n",
      "<P> As early as 1671 railed roads were in use in Durham to ease the conveyance of coal ; the first of these was the Tanfield Wagonway . Many of these tramroads or wagon ways were built in the 17th and 18th centuries . They used simply straight and parallel rails of timber on which carts with simple flanged iron wheels were drawn by horses , enabling several wagons to be moved simultaneously . </P>\n",
      "<P> Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology , but rather in the accounts of natural history , for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns , which they believed lived in India , a distant and fabulous realm for them . The earliest description is from Ctesias , who in his book Indika ( `` On India '' ) described them as wild asses , fleet of foot , having a horn a cubit and a half ( 700 mm , 28 inches ) in length , and colored white , red and black . Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one - horned animals , the oryx ( a kind of antelope ) and the so - called `` Indian ass '' . Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one - horned horses with stag - like heads . Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox ( perhaps a rhinoceros ) as one - horned beasts , as well as `` a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag , the feet of the elephant , and the tail of the boar , while the rest of the body is like that of the horse ; it makes a deep lowing noise , and has a single black horn , which projects from the middle of its forehead , two cubits ( 900 mm , 35 inches ) in length . '' In On the Nature of Animals ( Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος , De natura animalium ) , Aelian , quoting Ctesias , adds that India produces also a one - horned horse ( iii. 41 ; iv. 52 ) , and says ( xvi. 20 ) that the monoceros ( Greek : μονόκερως ) was sometimes called cartazonos ( Greek : καρτάζωνος ) , which may be a form of the Arabic karkadann , meaning `` rhinoceros '' . </P>\n",
      "<P> The First Battle of Bull Run ( the name used by Union forces ) , also known as the First Battle of Manassas ( the name used by Confederate forces ) , was fought on July 21 , 1861 in Prince William County , Virginia , just north of the city of Manassas and about 25 miles west - southwest of Washington , D.C. It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . </P>\n",
      "<P> Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone . </P>\n",

      "<P> Castles served a range of purposes , the most important of which were military , administrative , and domestic . As well as defensive structures , castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations in enemy territory . Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country 's inhabitants . As William the Conqueror advanced through England , he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken . Between 1066 and 1087 , he established 36 castles such as Warwick Castle , which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands . </P>\n",
      "<P> The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show remained in syndicated reruns and was still available for local television stations through The Program Exchange as late as 2016 ; WBBZ - TV , for instance , aired the show in a strip to counterprogram 10 PM newscasts in the Buffalo , New York market during the summer 2013 season . The underlying rights are now owned by Universal Pictures , which holds the library of predecessor companies DreamWorks Animation and Classic Media , and who in turn with copyright holder Ward Productions forms the joint venture Bullwinkle Studios , which manages the Rocky and Bullwinkle properties ; Universal 's purchase of Classic Media coincided with The Program Exchange 's shutdown . </P>\n",
      "<P> When Yellowstone National Park was created in 1872 , gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) populations were already in decline in Montana , Wyoming and Idaho . The creation of the national park did not provide protection for wolves or other predators , and government predator control programs in the first decades of the 1900s essentially helped eliminate the gray wolf from Yellowstone . The last wolves were killed in Yellowstone in 1926 . After that time , sporadic reports of wolves still occurred , but scientists confirmed that sustainable wolf populations had been extirpated and were absent from Yellowstone during the mid-1900s . </P>\n",

      "Context is: <P> The term was originally used in the United States in the late - 19th and early - 20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas . The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events . Performances were generally held in open - air arenas , such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger , more elaborate performers or performances . The most notorious was `` Prof. Gentry 's Famous Dog & Pony Show , '' started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act , originally entitled `` Gentry 's Equine and Canine Paradox . '' It started small , but evolved into a full circus show . Other early dog and pony shows included Morris ' Equine and Canine Paradoxes ( 1883 ) and Hurlburt 's Dog and Pony Show ( late 1880s ) . </P>\n",
      "<P> The Dust Bowl , also known as the Dirty Thirties , was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s ; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion ( the Aeolian processes ) caused the phenomenon . The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds . The rapid mechanization of farm equipment , especially small gasoline tractors , and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers ' decisions to convert arid grassland ( much of which received no more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of precipitation per year ) to cultivated cropland . </P>\n",

      "<P> Career records for batting average are usually subject to a minimum qualification of 20 innings played or completed , in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed . Under this qualification , the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia 's Sir Donald Bradman , with 99.94 . Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional , and that only five other players have averages over 60 , this is an outstanding statistic . The fact that Bradman 's average is so far above that of any other cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that , statistically at least , he was the greatest athlete in any sport . </P>\n",

      "Context is: <P> On January 17 , 1899 , under orders from President William McKinley , Commander Edward D. Taussig of USS Bennington landed on Wake and formally took possession of the island for the United States . After a 21 - gun salute , the flag was raised and a brass plate was affixed to the flagstaff with the following inscription : </P>\n",
      "<Li> 1960 Flag with 50 stars ( Hawaii ) </Li>\n",
      "<P> The flag of the United States of America , often referred to as the American flag , is the national flag of the United States . It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red ( top and bottom ) alternating with white , with a blue rectangle in the canton ( referred to specifically as the `` union '' ) bearing fifty small , white , five - pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows , where rows of six stars ( top and bottom ) alternate with rows of five stars . The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America , and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain , and became the first states in the U.S. Nicknames for the flag include The Stars and Stripes , Old Glory , and The Star - Spangled Banner . </P>\n",
      "<P> The Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America . It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch , a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools . The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892 , and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942 . The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945 . The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day in 1954 , when the words `` under God '' were added . </P>\n",
      "<P> In modern times , the U.S. military plays ( or sounds ) `` Reveille '' in the morning , generally near sunrise , though its exact time varies from base to base . On U.S. Army posts and Air Force bases , `` Reveille '' is played by itself or followed by the bugle call `` To the Colors '' at which time the national flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel outdoors are required to come to attention and present a salute in uniform , either to the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible . While in formation , soldiers are brought to the position of parade rest while `` Reveille '' plays then called to attention and present arms as the national flag is raised . On board U.S. Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard facilities , the flag is generally raised at 0800 ( 8 am ) while `` The Star Spangled Banner '' or the bugle call `` To the Colors '' is played . On some U.S. military bases , `` Reveille '' is accompanied by a cannon shot . </P>\n",
      "<P> When the National Anthem was first recognized by law in 1932 , there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing . On June 22 , 1942 , the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing , while others should simply stand at attention , men removing their hats . ( The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the Anthem , but not if the flag was not present . ) On December 23 , 1942 the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played . That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed . Those in uniform were required to salute . On July 7 , 1976 , the law was simplified . Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts , men removing their hats , irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting . On August 12 , 1998 , the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions , but differentiating between `` those in uniform '' and `` members of the Armed Forces and veterans '' who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed . Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegence versus the National Anthem , throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem , and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand ( or hat ) over their heart . After 9 / 11 , the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the Anthem became nearly universal . </P>\n",
      "<P> A flag designed by John McConnell in 1969 for the first Earth Day is a dark blue field charged with The Blue Marble , a famous NASA photo of the Earth as seen from outer space . The first edition of McConnell 's flag used screen - printing and used different colors : ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white . McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration . </P>\n",
      "<P> The torch - bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , of the New York World , started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was built in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker - tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . </P>\n",
      "<P> The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay , based on the U.S flag , where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies . The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes ; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance . The Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810 ; according to the historian Diego Abad de Santillán , the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti , the sun god of the Inca religion . It also appears in the Flag of Argentina and the Coat of Arms of Bolivia . </P>\n",
      "<P> The anthem has been recorded and performed in many different languages , usually as a result of the hosting of either form of the Games in various countries . The IOC does n't require that the anthem be performed in either English or Greek . But in the 2008 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Beijing , China , Greek was sung instead of the host country 's official language , Mandarin . Also in the 2016 Olympic opening ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , English was also sung instead of host country 's official language , Portuguese . </P>\n",
      "<P> The United States Oath of Allegiance , officially referred to as the `` Oath of Allegiance , '' 8 C.F.R. Part 337 ( 2008 ) , is an allegiance oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens . </P>\n",
      "<P> During the first half of the 19th century , seven stars were added to the flag to represent the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence , being the provinces of Caracas , Cumaná , Barcelona , Barinas , Margarita , Mérida , and Trujillo . </P>\n",
      "<P> With the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the seizure of Guam and the Philippines during the Spanish -- American War that same year , the United States began to consider unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island , located approximately halfway between Honolulu and Manila , as a good location for a telegraph cable station and coaling station for refueling warships of the rapidly expanding United States Navy and passing merchant and passenger steamships . On July 4 , 1898 , United States Army Brigadier General Francis V. Greene of the 2nd Brigade , Philippine Expeditionary Force , of the Eighth Army Corps , stopped at Wake Island and raised the American flag while en route to the Philippines on the steamship liner SS China . </P>\n",
      "<P> On Opening Day , April 9 , 1965 , a sold - out crowd of 47,879 watched an exhibition game between the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees . President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife Lady Bird were in attendance , as well as Texas Governor John Connally and Houston Mayor Louie Welch . Governor Connally tossed out the first ball for the first game ever played indoors . Dick `` Turk '' Farrell of the Astros threw the first pitch . Mickey Mantle had both the first hit ( a single ) and the first home run in the Astrodome . The Astros beat the Yankees that night , 2 - 1 . </P>\n",

    "In this example, questions were directly selected from the dataset. RetrieveChat was able to answer the questions correctly in the first attempt as the retrieved context contained the necessary information in the first two cases. However, in the last three cases, the context with the highest similarity to the question embedding did not contain the required information to answer the question. As a result, the LLM model responded with `UPDATE CONTEXT`. With the unique and innovative ability to update context in RetrieveChat, the agent automatically updated the context and sent it to the LLM model again. After several rounds of this process, the agent was able to generate the correct answer to the questions."
