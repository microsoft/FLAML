    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Using RetrieveChat for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a convesational framework for retrieve augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `RetrieveAssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/notebook/autogen_agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially,`RetrieveAssistantAgent` and  `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",
