(arXiv:2307.00175v1 [cs.CL]). \\n Abstract: <p>We consider the questions of whether or not large language models (LLMs) have\\nbeliefs, and, if they do, how we might measure them. First, we evaluate two\\nexisting approaches, one due to Azaria and Mitchell (2023) and the other to\\nBurns et al. (2022). We provide empirical results that show that these methods\\nfail to generalize in very basic ways. We then argue that, even if LLMs have\\nbeliefs, these methods are unlikely to be successful for conceptual reasons.\\nThus, there is still no lie-detector for LLMs. After describing our empirical\\nresults we take a step back and consider whether or not we should expect LLMs\\nto have something like beliefs in the first place. We consider some recent\\narguments aiming to show that LLMs cannot have beliefs. We show that these\\narguments are misguided. We provide a more productive framing of questions\\nsurrounding the status of beliefs in LLMs, and highlight the empirical nature\\nof the problem. We conclude by suggesting some concrete paths for future work.\\n</p>', 'Title: How to Index Item IDs for Recommendation Foundation Models. (arXiv:2305.06569v3 [cs.IR] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>Recommendation foundation model utilizes large language models (LLM) for\\nrecommendation by converting recommendation tasks into natural language tasks.\\nIt enables generative recommendation which directly generates the item(s) to\\nrecommend rather than calculating a ranking score for each and every candidate\\nitem in traditional recommendation models, simplifying the recommendation\\npipeline from multi-stage filtering to single-stage filtering. To avoid\\ngenerating excessively long text when deciding which item(s) to recommend,\\ncreating LLM-compatible item IDs is essential for recommendation foundation\\nmodels. In this study, we systematically examine the item indexing problem for\\nrecommendation foundation models, using P5 as the representative backbone model\\nand replicating its results with various indexing methods. To emphasize the\\nimportance of item indexing, we first discuss the issues of several trivial\\nitem indexing methods, such as independent indexing, title indexing, and random\\nindexing. We then propose four simple yet effective solutions, including\\nsequential indexing, collaborative indexing, semantic (content-based) indexing,\\nand hybrid indexing. Our reproducibility study of P5 highlights the significant\\ninfluence of item indexing methods on the model performance, and our results on\\nreal-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions.\\n</p>', 'Title: LLM-Blender: Ensembling Large Language Models with Pairwise Ranking and Generative Fusion.

Our framework consists of\\ntwo modules: PairRanker and GenFuser, addressing the observation that optimal\\nLLMs for different examples can significantly vary. PairRanker employs a\\nspecialized pairwise comparison method to distinguish subtle differences\\nbetween candidate outputs. It jointly encodes the input text and a pair of\\ncandidates, using cross-attention encoders to determine the superior one. Our\\nresults demonstrate that PairRanker exhibits the highest correlation with\\nChatGPT-based ranking. Then, GenFuser aims to merge the top-ranked candidates,\\ngenerating an improved output by capitalizing on their strengths and mitigating\\ntheir weaknesses. To facilitate large-scale evaluation, we introduce a\\nbenchmark dataset, MixInstruct, which is a mixture of multiple instruction\\ndatasets featuring oracle pairwise comparisons.

(arXiv:2306.04634v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood\\nthe internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking\\nis a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the\\ndetection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question\\nremains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There,\\nwatermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten\\nto avoid detection.\\n</p>\\n<p>We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is re-written by humans,\\nparaphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a longer hand-written\\ndocument. We find that watermarks remain detectable even after human and\\nmachine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength of the watermark,\\nparaphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even longer fragments\\nof the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections when enough\\ntokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing the watermark\\nis detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting a 1e-5 false\\npositive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes that are\\nsensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large document,\\nand we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of detectors.\\n</p>\", \"Title: SparseOptimizer: Sparsify Language Models through Moreau-Yosida Regularization and Accelerate via Compiler Co-design. (arXiv:2306.15656v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>This paper introduces SparseOptimizer, a novel deep learning optimizer that\\nexploits Moreau-Yosida regularization to naturally induce sparsity in large\\nlanguage models such as BERT, ALBERT and GPT. Key to the design of\\nSparseOptimizer is an embedded shrinkage operator, which imparts sparsity\\ndirectly within the optimization process. This operator, backed by a sound\\ntheoretical framework, includes an analytical solution, thereby reinforcing the\\noptimizer's robustness and efficacy. Crucially, SparseOptimizer's plug-and-play\\nfunctionality eradicates the need for code modifications, making it a\\nuniversally adaptable tool for a wide array of large language models. Empirical\\nevaluations on benchmark datasets such as GLUE, RACE, SQuAD1, and SQuAD2\\nconfirm that SparseBERT and SparseALBERT, when sparsified using\\nSparseOptimizer, achieve performance comparable to their dense counterparts,\\nBERT and ALBERT, while significantly reducing their parameter count. Further,\\nthis work proposes an innovative optimizer-compiler co-design strategy,\\ndemonstrating the potential of inference acceleration (\\\\textbf{3.37x},\\n\\\\textbf{6.30x}, and \\\\textbf{7.15x} in comparison with Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\\nLLVM generic compile, respectively) in SparseBERT when paired with an\\nappropriately designed compiler. This study represents a significant step\\nforward in the evolution of efficient, scalable, and high-performing large\\nlanguage models, setting a precedent for future exploration and optimization in\\nthis domain. The SparseOptimizer code and SparseALBERT model will be publicly\\navailable upon paper acceptance.\\n</p>\"]\n",

(arXiv:2307.00112v1 [cs.CY]). \\n Abstract: <p>Artificial intelligence is gaining traction in more ways than ever before.\\nThe popularity of language models and AI-based businesses has soared since\\nChatGPT was made available to the general public via OpenAI. It is becoming\\nincreasingly common for people to use ChatGPT both professionally and\\npersonally. Considering the widespread use of ChatGPT and the reliance people\\nplace on it, this study determined how reliable ChatGPT can be for answering\\ncomplex medical and clinical questions. Harvard University gross anatomy along\\nwith the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire were\\nused to accomplish the objective. The paper evaluated the obtained results\\nusing a 2-way ANOVA and posthoc analysis. Both showed systematic covariation\\nbetween format and prompt. Furthermore, the physician adjudicators\\nindependently rated the outcome's accuracy, concordance, and insight. As a\\nresult of the analysis, ChatGPT-generated answers were found to be more\\ncontext-oriented and represented a better model for deductive reasoning than\\nregular Google search results. Furthermore, ChatGPT obtained 58.8% on logical\\nquestions and 60% on ethical questions. This means that the ChatGPT is\\napproaching the passing range for logical questions and has crossed the\\nthreshold for ethical questions. The paper believes ChatGPT and other language\\nlearning models can be invaluable tools for e-learners; however, the study\\nsuggests that there is still room to improve their accuracy.

In this experimental study,\\nwe automated the process of feedback generation by employing OpenAI's GPT-3.5\\nmodel to generate personalized hints for students solving programming\\nassignments on an automated assessment platform.

The experimental group (with GPT hints\\nenabled) relied less on the platform's regular feedback but performed better in\\nterms of percentage of successful submissions across consecutive attempts for\\ntasks, where GPT hints were enabled. For tasks where the GPT feedback was made\\nunavailable, the experimental group needed significantly less time to solve\\nassignments. Furthermore, when GPT hints were unavailable, students in the\\nexperimental condition were initially less likely to solve the assignment\\ncorrectly. This suggests potential over-reliance on GPT-generated feedback.\\nHowever, students in the experimental condition were able to correct reasonably\\nrapidly, reaching the same percentage correct after seven submission attempts.\\nThe availability of GPT hints did not significantly impact students' affective\\nstate.\\n</p>\", 'Title: Personality Traits in Large Language Models.

As LLMs increasingly power conversational agents, the\\nsynthesized personality embedded in these models by virtue of their training on\\nlarge amounts of human-generated data draws attention. Since personality is an\\nimportant factor determining the effectiveness of communication, we present a\\ncomprehensive method for administering validated psychometric tests and\\nquantifying, analyzing, and shaping personality traits exhibited in text\\ngenerated from widely-used LLMs. We find that: 1) personality simulated in the\\noutputs of some LLMs (under specific prompting configurations) is reliable and\\nvalid; 2) evidence of reliability and validity of LLM-simulated personality is\\nstronger for larger and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in\\nLLM outputs can be shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific\\npersonality profiles.

Recent work has shown that the precise details of the inputs\\nused in the prompt significantly impacts ICL, which has incentivized\\ninstruction selection algorithms. The effect of instruction-choice however is\\nseverely underexplored, with existing analyses being restricted to shallow\\nsubsets of models and tasks, which limits the generalizability of their\\ninsights. We develop an ICL evaluation suite to conduct a thorough assessment\\nof these techniques. The suite includes 13 open-sourced LLMs of varying scales\\nfrom 4 distinct model families and covers 9 different tasks, representing a\\nrange of task types across 3 categories. In this work, we evaluate the relative\\nperformance of 7 popular instruction selection methods using our benchmark over\\nfive desiderata relevant to ICL. We discover that using curated\\nmanually-written instructions and simple instructions without any task-specific\\ndescriptions often elicits superior ICL performance than that of automatic\\ninstruction-induction methods, pointing to a lack of generalizability among the\\nlatter. We release our evaluation suite for benchmarking instruction selection\\napproaches, and call for more rigorous and generalizable methods in this space.\\n</p>', 'Title: Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Summarization via Large Language Models.

Recently, the emergence\\nof Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, ChatGPT and GPT-4, has\\nattracted wide attention from the computational linguistics community. However,\\nit is not yet known the performance of LLMs on CLS. In this report, we\\nempirically use various prompts to guide LLMs to perform zero-shot CLS from\\ndifferent paradigms (i.e., end-to-end and pipeline), and provide a preliminary\\nevaluation on the generated summaries. We find that ChatGPT and GPT-4\\noriginally prefer to produce lengthy summaries with detailed information. These\\ntwo LLMs can further balance informativeness and conciseness with the help of\\nan interactive prompt, significantly improving their CLS performance.\\nExperimental results on three widely-used CLS datasets show that GPT-4 achieves\\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot CLS performance, and performs competitively compared\\nwith the fine-tuned mBART-50. Moreover, we also find some multi-lingual and\\nbilingual LLMs (i.e., BLOOMZ, ChatGLM-6B, Vicuna-13B and ChatYuan) have limited\\nzero-shot CLS ability. Due to the composite nature of CLS, which requires\\nmodels to perform summarization and translation simultaneously, accomplishing\\nthis task in a zero-shot manner is even a challenge for LLMs. Therefore, we\\nsincerely hope and recommend future LLM research could use CLS as a testbed.\\n</p>', 'Title: How to Index Item IDs for Recommendation Foundation Models.

      "data4learning: ['Title: Can We Trust AI-Generated Educational Content? Comparative Analysis of Human and AI-Generated Learning Resources. (arXiv:2306.10509v2 [cs.HC] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>As an increasing number of students move to online learning platforms that\\ndeliver personalized learning experiences, there is a great need for the\\nproduction of high-quality educational content. Large language models (LLMs)\\nappear to offer a promising solution to the rapid creation of learning\\nmaterials at scale, reducing the burden on instructors. In this study, we\\ninvestigated the potential for LLMs to produce learning resources in an\\nintroductory programming context, by comparing the quality of the resources\\ngenerated by an LLM with those created by students as part of a learnersourcing\\nactivity. Using a blind evaluation, students rated the correctness and\\nhelpfulness of resources generated by AI and their peers, after both were\\ninitially provided with identical exemplars. Our results show that the quality\\nof AI-generated resources, as perceived by students, is equivalent to the\\nquality of resources generated by their peers. This suggests that AI-generated\\nresources may serve as viable supplementary material in certain contexts.\\nResources generated by LLMs tend to closely mirror the given exemplars, whereas\\nstudent-generated resources exhibit greater variety in terms of content length\\nand specific syntax features used. The study highlights the need for further\\nresearch exploring different types of learning resources and a broader range of\\nsubject areas, and understanding the long-term impact of AI-generated resources\\non learning outcomes.\\n</p>', \"Title: SparseOptimizer: Sparsify Language Models through Moreau-Yosida Regularization and Accelerate via Compiler Co-design. (arXiv:2306.15656v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED). \\n Abstract: <p>This paper introduces SparseOptimizer, a novel deep learning optimizer that\\nexploits Moreau-Yosida regularization to naturally induce sparsity in large\\nlanguage models such as BERT, ALBERT and GPT. Key to the design of\\nSparseOptimizer is an embedded shrinkage operator, which imparts sparsity\\ndirectly within the optimization process. This operator, backed by a sound\\ntheoretical framework, includes an analytical solution, thereby reinforcing the\\noptimizer's robustness and efficacy. Crucially, SparseOptimizer's plug-and-play\\nfunctionality eradicates the need for code modifications, making it a\\nuniversally adaptable tool for a wide array of large language models. Empirical\\nevaluations on benchmark datasets such as GLUE, RACE, SQuAD1, and SQuAD2\\nconfirm that SparseBERT and SparseALBERT, when sparsified using\\nSparseOptimizer, achieve performance comparable to their dense counterparts,\\nBERT and ALBERT, while significantly reducing their parameter count. Further,\\nthis work proposes an innovative optimizer-compiler co-design strategy,\\ndemonstrating the potential of inference acceleration (\\\\textbf{3.37x},\\n\\\\textbf{6.30x}, and \\\\textbf{7.15x} in comparison with Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\\nLLVM generic compile, respectively) in SparseBERT when paired with an\\nappropriately designed compiler. This study represents a significant step\\nforward in the evolution of efficient, scalable, and high-performing large\\nlanguage models, setting a precedent for future exploration and optimization in\\nthis domain. The SparseOptimizer code and SparseALBERT model will be publicly\\navailable upon paper acceptance.\\n</p>\"]\n",
