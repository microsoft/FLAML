       "# Using MathChat to solve math problems\n",
       "\n",
       "MathChat is a convesational framework for math problem solving. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use MathChat to solve math problems. MathChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and `MathUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (More details in `autogen_agent_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb`). Essentially, `MathUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the MathChat prompts. The original implementation and exeperiments of MathChat are in this [branch](https://github.com/kevin666aa/FLAML/tree/gpt_math_solver/flaml/autogen/math), and you can find more details in our paper [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337).\n",

       "Correct Solution: If these two graphs intersect then the points of intersection occur when  \\[x^2+a=ax,\\] or  \\[x^2-ax+a=0.\\] This quadratic has solutions exactly when the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(-a)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot a\\geq0.\\] This simplifies to  \\[a(a-4)\\geq0.\\] This quadratic (in $a$) is nonnegative when $a$ and $a-4$ are either both $\\ge 0$ or both $\\le 0$. This is true for $a$ in $$(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty).$$ Therefore the line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty)}$.\n"
