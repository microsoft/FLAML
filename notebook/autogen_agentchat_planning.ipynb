    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Coding and Planning Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "`flaml.autogen` offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framwork allows tool use and human participance through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use multiple agents to work together and accomplish a task which requires finding info from the web and coding. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write and debug Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the LLM-based `AssistantAgent` with a different system message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option and docker:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install flaml[autogen] docker\n",
    "```"
