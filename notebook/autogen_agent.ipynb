    "# Interactive LLM Agent for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers a suite of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `PythonAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `PythonAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `PythonAgent`. By setting `user_interaction_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `PythonAgent`. For example, when `user_interaction_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `PythonAgent` without doing any additional steps. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `PythonAgent` directly and returns the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `PythonAgent`.  \n",
