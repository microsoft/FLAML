    "MathChat is a convesational framework for math problem solving, and a user proxy agent is used to enable an automatic coversation with the LLM assistant. The current agent framework clearly defines the assistant agent and the user proxy agent. We implement `MathUserProxyAgent` based on the framework and take it as our final implementation of MathChat, which can be extended to allow human inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- You can also input your customized prompt if needed: `mathproxyagent.init_chat(problem, custimized_prompt=\"Your customized prompt\")`.\n",
    " Since this mathproxyagent detects '\\boxed{}' as termination, you need to have a similar termination sentence in the prompt: \"If you get the answer, put the answer in \\\\boxed{}.\". If the customized is provided, the `prompt_type` will be ignored.\n",

    "Problem: Find all numbers $a$ for which the graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the graph of $y=ax$ intersect. Express your answer in interval notation.\n",

    "Solution: If these two graphs intersect then the points of intersection occur when  \\[x^2+a=ax,\\] or  \\[x^2-ax+a=0.\\] This quadratic has solutions exactly when the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(-a)^2-4\\cdot1\\cdot a\\geq0.\\] This simplifies to  \\[a(a-4)\\geq0.\\] This quadratic (in $a$) is nonnegative when $a$ and $a-4$ are either both $\\ge 0$ or both $\\le 0$. This is true for $a$ in $$(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty).$$ Therefore the line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty)}$."
