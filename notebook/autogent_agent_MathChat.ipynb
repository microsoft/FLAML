The current agent framework clearly defines the assistant agent and the user proxy agent. We implement `MathUserProxyAgent` based on the framework and take it as our final implementation of MathChat, which can be extended to allow human inputs.\n",

This is true for $a$ in $$(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty).$$ Therefore the line and quadratic intersect exactly when $a$ is in $\\boxed{(-\\infty,0]\\cup[4,\\infty)}$."
