    "# Implement MathChat with the Agent framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the current agent, we can implement the MathChat framework directly. MathChat is a convesational framework for math problem solving, and a user proxy agent is used to enable an automatic coversation with the LLM assistant. The current agent framework clearly defines the assistant agent and the user proxy agent, and further allows human inputs. By inheriting the `UserProxyAgent` class, we can implement the original user proxy agent in MathChat, which we name it `MathUserProxyAgent` under the current framework. Throught investiagting in several problems, we find this new implementation of MathChat is **the same** as that in the original MathChat framework. \n",
    "The original implementation of MathChat is in this [branch](https://github.com/kevin666aa/FLAML/tree/gpt_math_solver/flaml/autogen/math), and you can find more details in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337).\n",
