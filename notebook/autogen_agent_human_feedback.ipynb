    "# Interactive LLM Agent with Human Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to solve a challenging math problem with human feedback. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"ALWAYS\", the `UserProxyAgent` will always prompt the user for feedback. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent` without doing any additional steps. When no user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
