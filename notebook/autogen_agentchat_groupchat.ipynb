      "1. **Automated theorem proving**: GPT-4 can be utilized in the development of automated theorem proving software that attempts to prove complex mathematical problems taken from International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) or other challenging sources. By fine-tuning GPT-4 with a dataset like FIMO consisting of formal mathematical problems, the model can potentially better understand the problem statements and generate appropriate proofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mathematical problem-solving assistants**: Software tools can be developed using GPT-4 to guide users in solving complex mathematical problems. The AI model can be integrated into educational platforms, online math tutoring services, or even standalone tools to help make solving problems easier and faster for students and professionals alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Formal language translation**: GPT-4 can potentially be integrated into software for translating between formal languages, assisting in the understanding and comparison of various formal systems. This would be especially useful in research communities employing different formal languages and wanting to share ideas and results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mathematical proof checking**: GPT-4 can be employed in proof-checking software to identify and correct inconsistencies. By improving the correctness of proofs, this application would ultimately help users save time and contribute to the overall quality of mathematical research.\n",
      "\n",
