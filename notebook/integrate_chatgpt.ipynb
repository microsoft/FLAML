    "FLAML offers a cost-effective hyperparameter optimization technique [EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673) for tuning Large Language Models. Our study finds that tuning hyperparameters can significantly improve the utility of LLMs.\n",

    "In this notebook, we tune OpenAI ChatGPT (both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) models for math problem solving. We use [the MATH benchmark](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/?group=math_chain_of_thought) for measuring mathematical problem solving on competition math problems with chain-of-thoughts style reasoning. \n",
