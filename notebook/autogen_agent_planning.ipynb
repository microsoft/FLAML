    "# Multi-Agent Communication and Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML offers an experimental feature of interactive LLM agents, which can be used to solve various tasks with human or automatic feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Auto-Generation#agents-experimental).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use multiple agents to work together and accomplish a task which requires finding info from the web and coding. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We further create a planning agent for the assistant agent to consult. The planning agent is a variation of the `AssistantAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "FLAML requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install flaml with the [autogen] option:\n",
    "```bash\n",
