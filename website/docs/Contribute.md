# Contributing

This project welcomes and encourages all forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

- Pushing patches.
- Code review of pull requests.
- Documentation, examples and test cases.
- Readability improvement, e.g., improvement on docstr and comments.
- Community participation in [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/issues), [discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/discussions), and [discord](https://discord.gg/7ZVfhbTQZ5).
- Tutorials, blog posts, talks that promote the project.
- Sharing application scenarios and/or related research.

You can take a look at the [Roadmap for Upcoming Features](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/wiki/Roadmap-for-Upcoming-Features) to identify potential things to work on.

Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.

If you are new to GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) is a detailed help source on getting involved with development on GitHub.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## How to make a good bug report

When you submit an issue to [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/issues), please do your best to
follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot easier to provide you with good
feedback:

- The ideal bug report contains a short reproducible code snippet. This way
  anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) for more details). If your snippet is
  longer than around 50 lines, please link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) or a GitHub repo.

- If an exception is raised, please **provide the full traceback**.

- Please include your **operating system type and version number**, as well as
  your **Python, flaml, scikit-learn versions**. The version of flaml
  can be found by running the following code snippet:

```python
import flaml

print(flaml.__version__)
```

- Please ensure all **code snippets and error messages are formatted in
  appropriate code blocks**.  See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)
  for more details.

## Becoming a Reviewer

There is currently no formal reviewer solicitation process. Current reviewers identify reviewers from active contributors. If you are willing to become a reviewer, you are welcome to let us know on discord.

## Developing

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML.git
pip install -e FLAML[notebook,autogen]
```

In case the `pip install` command fails, try escaping the brackets such as `pip install -e FLAML\[notebook,autogen\]`.

### Docker

We provide a simple [Dockerfile](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/Dockerfile).

```bash
docker build https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML.git#main -t flaml-dev
docker run -it flaml-dev
```

### Develop in Remote Container

If you use vscode, you can open the FLAML folder in a [Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
We have provided the configuration in [devcontainer](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/main/.devcontainer).

### Pre-commit

Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your git hooks. Before you commit, run
`pre-commit run` to check if you meet the pre-commit requirements. If you use Windows (without WSL) and can't commit after installing pre-commit, you can run `pre-commit uninstall` to uninstall the hook. In WSL or Linux this is supposed to work.

### Coverage

Any code you commit should not decrease coverage. To run all unit tests, install the \[test\] option under FLAML/:

```bash
pip install -e."[test]"
coverage run -m pytest test
```

Then you can see the coverage report by
`coverage report -m` or `coverage html`.

### Documentation

To build and test documentation locally, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). For example,

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

Then:

```console
npm install --global yarn  # skip if you use the dev container we provided
pip install pydoc-markdown==4.5.0  # skip if you use the dev container we provided
cd website
yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-engines
pydoc-markdown
yarn start
```

The last command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
