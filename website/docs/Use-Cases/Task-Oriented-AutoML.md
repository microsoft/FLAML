# Task Oriented AutoML

## Overview

`flaml.AutoML` is a class for task-oriented AutoML. It can be used as a scikit-learn style estimator with the standard `fit` and `predict` functions. The minimal inputs from users are the training data and the task type.

* Training data:
    - numpy array. When the input data are stored in numpy array, they are passed to `fit()` as `X_train` and `y_train`.
    - pandas dataframe. When the input data are stored in pandas dataframe, they are passed to `fit()` either as `X_train` and `y_train`, or as `dataframe` and `label`.
* Tasks (specified via `task`):
    - 'classification': classification.
    - 'regression': regression.
    - 'ts_forecast': time series forecasting.
    - 'rank': learning to rank.
    - 'seq-classification': sequence classification.
    - 'seq-regression': sequence regression.
    - 'summarization': text summarization.

An optional input is `time_budget` for searching models and hyperparameters. When not specified, a default budget of 60 seconds will be used.

A typical way to use `flaml.AutoML`:

```python
# Prepare training data
# ...
from flaml import AutoML
automl = AutoML()
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="regression", time_budget=60, **other_settings)
# Save the model
with open("automl.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(automl, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

# At prediction time
with open("automl.pkl", "rb") as f:
    automl = pickle.load(f)
pred = automl.predict(X_test)
```

If users provide the minimal inputs only, `AutoML` uses the default settings for time budget, optimization metric, estimator list etc.

## Customize AutoML.fit()

### Optimization metric

The optimization metric is specified via the `metric` argument. It can be either a string which refers to a built-in metric, or a user-defined function.

* Built-in metric.
    - 'accuracy': 1 - accuracy as the corresponding metric to minimize.
    - 'log_loss': default metric for multiclass classification.
    - 'r2': 1 - r2_score as the corresponding metric to minimize. Default metric for regression.
    - 'rmse': root mean squared error.
    - 'mse': mean squared error.
    - 'mae': mean absolute error.
    - 'mape': mean absolute percentage error.
    - 'roc_auc': minimize 1 - roc_auc_score. Default metric for binary classification.
    - 'roc_auc_ovr': minimize 1 - roc_auc_score with `multi_class="ovr"`.
    - 'roc_auc_ovo': minimize 1 - roc_auc_score with `multi_class="ovo"`.
    - 'f1': minimize 1 - f1_score.
    - 'micro_f1': minimize 1 - f1_score with `average="micro"`.
    - 'micro_f1': minimize 1 - f1_score with `average="micro"`.
    - 'ap': minimize 1 - average_precision_score.
    - 'ndcg': minimize 1 - ndcg_score.
    - 'ndcg@k': minimize 1 - ndcg_score@k. k is an integer.
* User-defined function.
A customized metric function that requires the following (input) signature, and returns the input configâ€™s value in terms of the metric you want to minimize, and a dictionary of auxiliary information at your choice:

```python
def custom_metric(
    X_val, y_val, estimator, labels,
    X_train, y_train, weight_val=None, weight_train=None,
    config=None, groups_val=None, groups_train=None,
):
    return metric_to_minimize, metrics_to_log
```

For example,
```python
def custom_metric(
    X_val, y_val, estimator, labels,
    X_train, y_train, weight_val=None, weight_train=None,
    **args,
):
    from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
    import time

    start = time.time()
    y_pred = estimator.predict_proba(X_val)
    pred_time = (time.time() - start) / len(X_val)
    val_loss = log_loss(y_val, y_pred, labels=labels, sample_weight=weight_val)
    y_pred = estimator.predict_proba(X_train)
    train_loss = log_loss(y_train, y_pred, labels=labels, sample_weight=weight_train)
    alpha = 0.5
    return val_loss * (1 + alpha) - alpha * train_loss, {
        "val_loss": val_loss,
        "train_loss": train_loss,
        "pred_time": pred_time,
    }
```
It returns the validation loss penalized by the gap between validation and training loss as the metric to minimize, and three metrics to log: val_loss, train_loss and pred_time. The arguments `config`, `groups_val` and `groups_train` are not used in the function.

### Estimator and search space

The estimator list can contain one or more estimator names, each corresponding to a built-in estimator or a custom estimator. Each estimator has a search space for hyperparameter configurations. FLAML supports both classical machine learning models and deep neural networks.

#### Estimator
* Built-in estimator.
    - 'lgbm': LGBMEstimator. Hyperparameters: n_estimators, num_leaves, min_child_samples, learning_rate, log_max_bin (logarithm of (max_bin + 1) with base 2), colsample_bytree, reg_alpha, reg_lambda.
    - 'xgboost': XGBoostSkLearnEstimator. Hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_leaves, max_depth, min_child_weight, learning_rate, subsample, colsample_bylevel, colsample_bytree, reg_alpha, reg_lambda.
    - 'rf': RandomForestEstimator. Hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_features, max_leaves, criterion (for classification only).
    - 'extra_tree': ExtraTreesEstimator. Hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_features, max_leaves, criterion (for classification only).
    - 'lrl1': LRL1Classifier (sklearn.LogisticRegression with L1 regularization). Hyperparameters: C.
    - 'lrl2': LRL2Classifier (sklearn.LogisticRegression with L2 regularization). Hyperparameters: C.
    - 'catboost': CatBoostEstimator. Hyperparameters: early_stopping_rounds, learning_rate, n_estimators.
    - 'kneighbor': KNeighborsEstimator. Hyperparameters: n_neighbors.
    - 'prophet': Prophet. Hyperparameters: changepoint_prior_scale, seasonality_prior_scale, holidays_prior_scale, seasonality_mode.
    - 'arima': ARIMA. Hyperparameters: p, d, q.
    - 'sarimax': SARIMAX. Hyperparameters: p, d, q, P, D, Q, s.
    - 'transformer': Huggingface transformer models. Hyperparameters: learning_rate, num_train_epochs, per_device_train_batch_size, warmup_ratio, weight_decay, adam_epsilon, seed.
* Custom estimator. Use custom estimator for:
    - tuning an estimator that is not built-in;
    - customizing search space for a built-in estimator.

To tune a custom estimator that is not built-in, you need to:

1. Build a custom estimator by inheritting `flaml.model.BaseEstimator` or a derived class.
For example, if you have a estimator class with scikit-learn style `fit()` and `predict()` functions, you only need to set `self.estimator_class` to be that class in your constructor.

```python
from flaml.model import SKLearnEstimator
# SKLearnEstimator is derived from BaseEstimator
import rgf

class MyRegularizedGreedyForest(SKLearnEstimator):
    def __init__(self, task="binary", **config):
        super().__init__(task, **config)

        if task in CLASSIFICATION:
            from rgf.sklearn import RGFClassifier

            self.estimator_class = RGFClassifier
        else:
            from rgf.sklearn import RGFRegressor

            self.estimator_class = RGFRegressor

    @classmethod
    def search_space(cls, data_size, task):
        space = {
            "max_leaf": {
                "domain": tune.lograndint(lower=4, upper=data_size),
                "low_cost_init_value": 4,
            },
            "n_iter": {
                "domain": tune.lograndint(lower=1, upper=data_size),
                "low_cost_init_value": 1,
            },
            "learning_rate": {"domain": tune.loguniform(lower=0.01, upper=20.0)},
            "min_samples_leaf": {
                "domain": tune.lograndint(lower=1, upper=20),
                "init_value": 20,
            },
        }
        return space
```

In the constructor, we set `self.estimator_class` as `RGFClassifier` or `RGFRegressor` according to the task type. If the estimator you want to tune does not have a scikit-learn style `fit()` and `predict()` API, you can override the `fit()` and `predict()` function of `flaml.model.BaseEstimator`, like [XGBoostEstimator](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML/blob/59083fbdcb95c15819a0063a355969203022271c/flaml/model.py#L511).

2. Give the custom estimator a name and add it in AutoML. E.g.,

```python
from flaml import AutoML
automl = AutoML()
automl.add_learner("rgf", MyRegularizedGreedyForest)
```

This registers the `MyRegularizedGreedyForest` class in AutoML, with the name "rgf".

3. Tune the newly added custom estimator in either of the following two ways depending on your needs:
- tune rgf alone: `automl.fit(..., estimator_list=["rgf"])`; or
- mix it with other built-in learners: `automl.fit(..., estimator_list=["rgf", "lgbm", "xgboost", "rf"])`.

#### Search space

Each estimator class, built-in or not, must have a `search_space` function. In the `search_space` function, we return a dictionary about the hyperparameters, the keys of which are the names of the hyperparameters to tune, and each value is a set of detailed search configurations about the corresponding hyperparameters represented in a dictionary. A search configuration dictionary includes the following fields:
* `domain`, which specifies the possible values of the hyperparameter and their distribution. Please refer to [more details about the search space domain](Tune-User-Defined-Function#more-details-about-the-search-space-domain).
* `init_value` (optional), which specifies the initial value of the hyperparameter.
* `low_cost_init_value`(optional), which specifies the value of the hyperparameter that is associated with low computation cost. See [cost related hyperparameters](Tune-User-Defined-Function#cost-related-hyperparameters) or [FAQ](../FAQ#about-low_cost_partial_config-in-tune) for more details.

In the example above, we tune four hyperparameters, three integers and one float. They all follow a log-uniform distribution. "max_leaf" and "n_iter" have "low_cost_init_value" specified as their values heavily influence the training cost.




To customize the search space for a built-in estimator, use a similar approach to define a class that inherits the existing estimator. For example,

```python
from flaml.model import XGBoostEstimator

def logregobj(preds, dtrain):
    labels = dtrain.get_label()
    preds = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-preds))  # transform raw leaf weight
    grad = preds - labels
    hess = preds * (1.0 - preds)
    return grad, hess

class MyXGB1(XGBoostEstimator):
    """XGBoostEstimator with logregobj as the objective function"""

    def __init__(self, **config):
        super().__init__(objective=logregobj, **config)
```

We override the constructor and set the training objective as a custom function `logregobj`. The hyperparameters and their search range do not change. For another example,

```python
class XGBoost2D(XGBoostSklearnEstimator):
    @classmethod
    def search_space(cls, data_size, task):
        upper = min(32768, int(data_size))
        return {
            "n_estimators": {
                "domain": tune.lograndint(lower=4, upper=upper),
                "low_cost_init_value": 4,
            },
            "max_leaves": {
                "domain": tune.lograndint(lower=4, upper=upper),
                "low_cost_init_value": 4,
            },
        }
```

We override the `search_space` function to tune two hyperparameters only, "n_estimators" and "max_leaves". They are both random integers in the log space, ranging from 4 to data-dependent upper bound. The lower bound for each corresponds to low training cost, hence the "low_cost_init_value" for each is set to 4.

### Constraint

There are several types of constraints you can impose.

1. End-to-end constraints on the AutoML process.

- `time_budget`: constrains the wall-clock time (seconds) used by the AutoML process. We provide some tips on [how to set time budget](#how-to-set-time-budget).

- `max_iter`: constrains the maximal number of models to try in the AutoML process.

2. Constraints on the (hyperparameters of) the estimators.

Some constraints on the estimator can be implemented via the custom learner. For example,

```python
class MonotonicXGBoostEstimator(XGBoostSklearnEstimator):
    @classmethod
    def search_space(**args):
        return super().search_space(**args).update({"monotone_constraints": "(1, -1)"})
```

It adds a monotonicity constraint to XGBoost. This approach can be used to set any constraint that is a parameter in the underlying estimator's constructor.

3. Constraints on the models tried in AutoML.

Users can set constraints such as the maximal number of models to try, limit on training time and prediction time per model.
* `train_time_limit`: training time in seconds.
* `pred_time_limit`: prediction time per instance in seconds.

For example,
```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, max_iter=100, train_time_limit=1, pred_time_limit=1e-3)
```

### Ensemble

To use stacked ensemble after the model search, set `ensemble=True` or a dict. When `ensemble=True`, the final estimator and `passthrough` in the stacker will be automatically chosen. You can specify customized final estimator or passthrough option:
* "final_estimator": an instance of the final estimator in the stacker.
* "passthrough": True (default) or False, whether to pass the original features to the stacker.

For example,
```python
automl.fit(
    X_train, y_train, task="classification",
    "ensemble": {
        "final_estimator": LogisticRegression(),
        "passthrough": False,
    },
)
```

### Resampling strategy

By default, flaml decides the resampling automatically according to the data size and the time budget. If you would like to enforce a certain resampling strategy, you can set `eval_method` to be "holdout" or "cv" for holdout or cross-validation.

For holdout, you can also set:
* `split_ratio`: the fraction for validation data, 0.1 by default.
* `X_val`, `y_val`: a separate validation dataset. When they are passed, the validation metrics will be computed against this given validation dataset. If they are not passed, then a validation dataset will be split from the training data and held out from training during the model search. After the model search, flaml will retrain the model with best configuration on the full training data.
You can set`retrain_full` to be `False` to skip the final retraining or "budget" to ask flaml to do its best to retrain within the time budget.

For cross validation, you can also set `n_splits` of the number of folds. By default it is 5.

#### Data split method

By default, flaml uses the following method to split the data:
* stratified split for classification;
* uniform split for regression;
* time-based split for time series forecasting;
* group-based split for learning to rank.

The data split method for classification can be changed into uniform split by setting `split_type="uniform"`. For both classification and regression, time-based split can be enforced if the data are sorted by timestamps, by setting `split_type="time"`.

### Parallel tuning

When you have parallel resources, you can either spend them in training and keep the model search sequential, or perform parallel search. Following scikit-learn, the parameter `n_jobs` specifies how many CPU cores to use for each training job. The number of parallel trials is specified via the parameter `n_concurrent_trials`. By default, `n_jobs=-1, n_concurrent_trials=1`. That is, all the CPU cores (in a single compute node) are used for training a single model and the search is sequential. When you have more resources than what each single training job needs, you can consider increasing `n_concurrent_trials`.

To do parallel tuning, install the `ray` and `blendsearch` options:
```bash
pip install flaml[ray,blendsearch]
```

`ray` is used to manage the resources. For example,
```python
ray.init(n_cpus=16)
```
allocates 16 CPU cores. Then, when you run:
```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, n_jobs=4, n_concurrent_trials=4)
```
flaml will perform 4 trials in parallel, each consuming 4 CPU cores. The parallel tuning uses the [BlendSearch](Tune-User-Defined-Function##blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) algorithm.


### Warm start

We can warm start the AutoML by providing starting points of hyperparameter configurstions for each estimator. For example, if you have run AutoML for one hour, after checking the results, you would like to run it for another two hours, then you can use the best configurations found for each estimator as the starting points for the new run.

```python
automl1 = AutoML()
automl1.fit(X_train, y_train, time_budget=3600)
automl2 = AutoML()
automl2.fit(X_train, y_train, time_budget=7200, starting_points=automl1.best_config_per_estimator)
```

`starting_points` is a dictionary. The keys are the estimator names. If you do not need to specify starting points for an estimator, exclude its name from the dictionary. The value for each key can be either a dictionary of a list of dictionaries, corresponding to one hyperparameter configuration, or multiple hyperparameter configurations, respectively.

### Log the trials

The trials are logged in a file if a `log_file_name` is passed.
Each trial is logged as a json record in one line. The best trial's id is logged in the last line. For example,
```
{"record_id": 0, "iter_per_learner": 1, "logged_metric": null, "trial_time": 0.12717914581298828, "wall_clock_time": 0.1728971004486084, "validation_loss": 0.07333333333333332, "config": {"n_estimators": 4, "num_leaves": 4, "min_child_samples": 20, "learning_rate": 0.09999999999999995, "log_max_bin": 8, "colsample_bytree": 1.0, "reg_alpha": 0.0009765625, "reg_lambda": 1.0}, "learner": "lgbm", "sample_size": 150}
{"record_id": 1, "iter_per_learner": 3, "logged_metric": null, "trial_time": 0.07027268409729004, "wall_clock_time": 0.3756711483001709, "validation_loss": 0.05333333333333332, "config": {"n_estimators": 4, "num_leaves": 4, "min_child_samples": 12, "learning_rate": 0.2677050123105203, "log_max_bin": 7, "colsample_bytree": 1.0, "reg_alpha": 0.001348364934537134, "reg_lambda": 1.4442580148221913}, "learner": "lgbm", "sample_size": 150}
{"curr_best_record_id": 1}
```

1. `iter_per_learner` means how many models have been tried for each learner. The reason you see records like `iter_per_learner=3` for `record_id=1` is that flaml only logs better configs than the previous iters by default, i.e., `log_type='better'`. If you use `log_type='all'` instead, all the trials will be logged.
1. `trial_time` means the time taken to train and evaluate one config in that trial. `total_search_time` is the total time spent from the beginning of `fit()`.
1. flaml will adjust the `n_estimators` for lightgbm etc. according to the remaining budget and check the time budget constraint and stop in several places. Most of the time that makes `fit()` stops before the given budget. Occasionally it may run over the time budget slightly. But the log file always contains the best config info and you can recover the best model until any time point using `retrain_from_log()`.

We can also use mlflow for logging:
```python
mlflow.set_experiment("flaml")
with mlflow.start_run():
    automl.fit(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train, **settings)
```

### Extra fit arguments

Extra fit arguments that are needed by the estimators can be passed to `AutoML.fit()`. For example, if there is a weight associated with each training example, they can be passed via `sample_weight`. For another example, `period` can be passed for time series forecaster. For any extra keywork argument passed to `AutoML.fit()` which has not been explicitly listed in the function signature, it will be passed to the underlying estimators' `fit()` as is.

## Retrieve and analyze the outcomes of AutoML.fit()

### Get best model

The best model can be obtained by the `model` property of an `AutoML` instance. For example,

```python
automl.fit(X_train, y_train, task="regression")
print(automl.mdoel)
# <flaml.model.LGBMEstimator object at 0x7f9b502c4550>
```

`flaml.model.LGBMEstimator` is a wrapper class for LightGBM models. To access the underlying model, use the `estimator` property of the `flaml.model.LGBMEstimator` instance.

```python
print(automl.model.estimator)
'''
LGBMRegressor(colsample_bytree=0.7610534336273627,
              learning_rate=0.41929025492645006, max_bin=255,
              min_child_samples=4, n_estimators=45, num_leaves=4,
              reg_alpha=0.0009765625, reg_lambda=0.009280655005879943,
              verbose=-1)
'''
```

Just like a normal LightGBM model, we can inspect it. For example, we can plot the feature importance:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.barh(automl.model.estimator.feature_name_, automl.model.estimator.feature_importances_)
```
![png](images/feature_importance.png)

### Get best configuration

We can find the best estimator's name and best configuration by:

```python
print(automl.best_estimator)
# lgbm
print(automl.best_config)
# {'n_estimators': 148, 'num_leaves': 18, 'min_child_samples': 3, 'learning_rate': 0.17402065726724145, 'log_max_bin': 8, 'colsample_bytree': 0.6649148062238498, 'reg_alpha': 0.0009765625, 'reg_lambda': 0.0067613624509965}
```

We can also find the best configuration per estimator.

```python
print(automl.best_config_per_estimator)
# {'lgbm': {'n_estimators': 148, 'num_leaves': 18, 'min_child_samples': 3, 'learning_rate': 0.17402065726724145, 'log_max_bin': 8, 'colsample_bytree': 0.6649148062238498, 'reg_alpha': 0.0009765625, 'reg_lambda': 0.0067613624509965}, 'rf': None, 'catboost': None, 'xgboost': {'n_estimators': 4, 'max_leaves': 4, 'min_child_weight': 1.8630223791106992, 'learning_rate': 1.0, 'subsample': 0.8513627344387318, 'colsample_bylevel': 1.0, 'colsample_bytree': 0.946138073111236, 'reg_alpha': 0.0018311776973217073, 'reg_lambda': 0.27901659190538414}, 'extra_tree': {'n_estimators': 4, 'max_features': 1.0, 'max_leaves': 4}}
```

The `None` value corresponds to the estimators which have not been tried.

Other useful information:
```python
print(automl.best_config_train_time)
# 0.24841618537902832
print(automl.best_iteration)
# 10
print(automl.best_loss)
# 0.15448622217577546
print(automl.time_to_find_best_model)
# 0.4167296886444092
print(automl.config_history)
# {0: ('lgbm', {'n_estimators': 4, 'num_leaves': 4, 'min_child_samples': 20, 'learning_rate': 0.09999999999999995, 'log_max_bin': 8, 'colsample_bytree': 1.0, 'reg_alpha': 0.0009765625, 'reg_lambda': 1.0}, 1.2300517559051514)}
# Meaning: at iteration 0, the config tried is {'n_estimators': 4, 'num_leaves': 4, 'min_child_samples': 20, 'learning_rate': 0.09999999999999995, 'log_max_bin': 8, 'colsample_bytree': 1.0, 'reg_alpha': 0.0009765625, 'reg_lambda': 1.0} for lgbm, and the wallclock time is 1.23s when this trial is finished.
```

### Plot learning curve

To plot how the loss is improved over time during the model search, first load the search history from the log file:

```python
from flaml.data import get_output_from_log

time_history, best_valid_loss_history, valid_loss_history, config_history, metric_history = \
    get_output_from_log(filename=settings["log_file_name"], time_budget=120)
```

Then, assuming the optimization metric is "accuracy", we can plot the accuracy versus wallclock time:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.title("Learning Curve")
plt.xlabel("Wall Clock Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Validation Accuracy")
plt.step(time_history, 1 - np.array(best_valid_loss_history), where="post")
plt.show()
```

![png](images/curve.png)

The curve suggests that increasing the time budget may further improve the accuracy.

### How to set time budget

* If you have an exact constraint for the total search time, set it as the time budget.
* If you have flexible time constraints, for example, your desirable time budget is t1=60s, and the longest time budget you can tolerate is t2=3600s, you can try the following two ways:
1. set t1 as the time budget, and check the message in the console log in the end. If the budget is too small, you will see a warning like
> WARNING - Time taken to find the best model is 91% of the provided time budget and not all estimators' hyperparameter search converged. Consider increasing the time budget.
2. set t2 as the time budget, and also set `early_stop=True`. If the early stopping is triggered, you will see a warning like
    > WARNING - All estimator hyperparameters local search has converged at least once, and the total search time exceeds 10 times the time taken to find the best model.

    > WARNING - Stopping search as early_stop is set to True.

### How much time is needed to find the best model

If you want to get a sense of how much time is needed to find the best model, you can use `max_iter=2` to perform two trials first. The message will be like:
> INFO - iteration 0, current learner lgbm

> INFO - Estimated sufficient time budget=145194s. Estimated necessary time budget=2118s.

> INFO -  at 2.6s,  estimator lgbm's best error=0.4459,     best estimator lgbm's best error=0.4459

You will see that the time to finish the first and cheapest trial is 2.6 seconds. The estimated necessary time budget is 2118 seconds, and the estimated sufficient time budget is 145194 seconds. Note that this is only an estimated range to help you decide your budget.
